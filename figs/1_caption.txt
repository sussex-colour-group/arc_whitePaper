2-dimensional histograms of the headcam data, split by location and season.

For each image, a mean chromaticity is computed.
For each season and location, these mean chromaticities are binned in two-dimensions (L/(L+M) and S/(L+M)).
The brightness of the each 2D bin (colored pixel) indicates how many images have means which fall within that bin.
The chromaticity of each bin indicates the chromaticity of that bin, though note that this is only provided as a rough approximation to help orient the reader within the space.

Both season and location are significant on L/(L+M), S/(L+M), and CL axes, with main effects and interaction effects for each (see `/stats/GoPro_LLM.csv`, `/stats/GoPro_SLM.csv`, and `/stats/GoPro_CL.csv` for ANOVA tables).
