A,B (top):
MB chromaticity plots comparing the distribution of environmental (headcam) data (white outline), with the distribution of psychophysics (white setting) data (coloured 2D histogram). 
Means with 95% CI are shown for the psychophysics data (red cross for Troms√∏, blue cross for Oslo).

C,D (bottom):
The results of the "white sniffer" analysis (Tromso, left. Oslo, right).
Images chosen for having the highest number of pixels matching the psychophysically-defined local white chromaticity.
Red blocking has been applied to areas which are of chromaticities outside of what is defined as local white, to enable a visual analysis of which areas of scenes might be informing the local definition of "white".
