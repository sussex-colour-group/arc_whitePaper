Chromatic means of the environmental (headcam) data and the psychophysics data, summarising varation between location and season, and additionally split by birth location.

A) Means of headcam data, split by location and season, with 95% confidence intervals.

Tromso headcam data is offset to the lower right (warmer chromaticities) relative to Oslo headcam data.
Both locations show roughly the same seasonal trend: Winter is offset to lower right (warmer chromaticities) compared to other seasons; Autumn also, but less so.

Within the dashed box the psychophysics (white setting) data is plotted, again split by location and season, with 95% confidence intervals.

Olso psychophysics data is offset to the lower right (warmer chromaticities) - a pattern which conflicts with the inter-location difference seen in the headcam data.

B) Zoom of the psychophysics data in A.

C) The psychophysics data which was collected in Tromso, splot by whether participants were born above or below the arctic circle.

## Psychophysics - Testing Location and Season
- Significant effect of location on L/(L+M), S/(L+M), and CL axes (see `/stats/PP_testing_LLM.csv`, `/stats/PP_testing_SLM.csv`, and `/stats/PP_testing_CL.csv` for ANOVA tables), and all other `/stats/PP_testing_*.csv` files for means and standard deviations.
- No effect of season, or interaction effects.

## Psychophysics - Birth Location and Season
- L/(L+M): significant effect of birth season (not location)
- S/(L+M): significant effect of birth location (not season)
- CL: No significant effects
- See `/stats/PP_birth_*.csv` for ANOVA tables
